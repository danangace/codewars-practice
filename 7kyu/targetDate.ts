/*
You have an amount of money a0 > 0 and you deposit it with an interest rate of p percent divided by 360 per day on the 1st of January 2016. You want to have an amount a >= a0.

Task:
The function date_nb_days (or dateNbDays...) with parameters a0, a, p will return, as a string, the date on which you have just reached a.

Example:
date_nb_days(100, 101, 0.98) --> "2017-01-01" (366 days)

date_nb_days(100, 150, 2.00) --> "2035-12-26" (7299 days)

Notes:
The return format of the date is "YYYY-MM-DD"
The deposit is always on the "2016-01-01"
Don't forget to take the rate for a day to be p divided by 36000 since banks consider that there are 360 days in a year.
You have: a0 > 0, p% > 0, a >= a0
